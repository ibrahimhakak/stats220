# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in computer science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am interested in being a data analyst when I graduate, so I'm taking stats papers this year
- I am interested in learning about how data models work and how large scale analysis can be conducted for businesses

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://tenor.com/view/ishowspeed-crying-sad-very-sad-speed-gif-24923499)
